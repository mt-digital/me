### Brief research interest history

For as long as I can remember I've loved to read and communicate, and I've been
interested in how people transfer knowledge between one another. My first
year of college was actually in the Newhouse School of Communication at Syracuse
University. I left that prestigious program to learn mathematics and physics, 
finishing with a double major in each in 2008. 

### Applied Physics Master's work

I received a M.S. in Applied Physics from Rice University in 2012, where my
thesis focused on a new form of sensing called "compressive sensing" where 
a signal is intentionally undersampled to save resources. Since most signals can
be compressed, we can in most cases recover all the information we want even
though traditionally this would not be possible. To understand the performance
of a new method for compressive sensing, I used thousands of CPUs to run Matlab
simulations of the sensing scheme. I also built microscopes and cameras based
on this new technology.

My thesis is availble on 
[Research
Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274720620_Experimental_and_Numerical_Investigations_of_Novel_Architectures_Applied_to_Compressive_Imaging_Systems).

### The last few years

Before my current position at the University of Idaho, I was a data engineer at
[Economic Modeling Specialists, Intl](http://www.economicmodeling.com) 
where I really learned to program and made my first modest foray into web 
development with this interactive [blog post on weather and
jobs](http://www.economicmodeling.com/2014/02/19/does-cold-weather-really-affect-job-growth/).

Currently I'm learning a lot of web development because it's the best way to
communicate ideas, plus the community gets a product that others can use. It's a
great, interactive way to demonstrate data management tools, and the apps
themselves are data management tools. I mainly program in Python since it's easy
to find the packages you need for whatever the task is. See my 
[GitHub repositories](https://github.com/mtpain?tab=repositories) 
for a better overview of the work I've been doing lately.
