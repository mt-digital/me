      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, welcome to my home page at the Northwest Knowledge Network at the
        University of Idaho. I am a research software developer interested in
        research data management and sharing, focusing on novel user interfaces
        and novel backend schemes for handling and generating metadata both
        about data and about models. I'm funded primarily by the 
        <a href="http://westernconsortium.org">WC-WAVE Project</a>, with some
        extra funds from a USGS to work on a 
        <a href="https://github.com/northwest-knowledge-network/mdedit">metadata editor</a>.
      </p>

  I just returned from Indiana University where I attended a workshop for the
  <a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/">Research Data Alliance</a> 
  <a href="https://rd-alliance.org/rda-data-share-announces-fellowship-awards.html">Data Share Fellowship </a>, which I was awarded at the end of May. My project with RDA will be
  to demonstrate the potential usefulness of linked open data in doing
  interdisciplinary research. For the current version of my project proposal,
  please see <a href="https://github.com/mtpain/rda-lod/blob/master/proposal.md">
  this version on github</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Before that, I traveled to Boise State University to participate in a 
  two-week training course on interdisciplinary modeling in hydrology. We 
  covered the economics of, social aspects, physical inputs, and parameters of
  hydrological models. As a final project, I put together a web app that allows
  a scientist to "run" a hydrological model through the web browser. Run is in
  quotes because in reality, the model has been pre-run for a set of predetermined
  inputs, and only those inputs may be selected by the user of the web app.
  See the <a href="https://github.com/mtpain/geos697">github repository</a>
  and the instructions there for installing and running the app.
